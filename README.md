## Overview

This is a fork of Google's [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit). It is modified to be suited for making static websites hosted on Github Pages.

## Browser Support

At present, we officially aim to support the following browsers:

* IE9, IE10, IE11
* FF 30, 31
* Chrome 34, 35
* Safari 7, 8
* iOS Safari 7, 8
* Android / Chrome 4.4, 4.4.3

This is not to say that Web Starter Kit cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that our focus will be on ensuring our layouts work great in the above.
