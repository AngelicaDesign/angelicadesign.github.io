    .heading Design Solution
    p The intention was to represent the band’s sound in a visual way as to inform the audience of the band’s characteristics. I drew influences from their stylized logo and traditional Latin folk art to create illustrations that set the tone for the concert. The illustrations have a lot of movement to suggest the upbeat rhythm and they are funky with a joyful energy. The chosen colors refer to the Latin culture and the texture creates a rustic feel and adds depth.
