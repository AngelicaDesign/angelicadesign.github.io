        p The goal was to create two posters that work as a single unit to promote a concert hosted by Sacramento State Unique. The Tibetan Method genre falls under a folk funk alternative indie. Their sound is soothing and very harmonic. They draw influences from Tibetan culture and have iconic instruments that they always use.
        .heading Design Solution
        p The intention was to represent their sound style in a visual way as to inform the audience of the bandâ€™s characteristics. I played around with connecting the concept of sound waves to that of Zen Sand Garden. The waves convey a soothing tone and reference the Zen-like culture of Tibet. I created illustrations of the instrument that they use and kept the composition simple and balanced. The colors were chosen for their warmth energy and the texture creates a vintage-rustic feel. The star burst pattern adds another layer of dimension and creates movement outwards from the instrument, like sound would do.
